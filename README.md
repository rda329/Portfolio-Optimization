# Portfolio Risk Optimization Using VaR

This project focuses on analyzing an existing Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) portfolio and exploring ways to minimize investment risk. While higher risk can potentially yield greater returns, the objective here is to develop a strategy aimed at achieving lower risk with consistent yields.

Objective
The primary goal of this project is to calculate the Value at Risk (VaR) for a given ETF portfolio and identify adjustments to optimize its composition, reducing overall risk without compromising stability.

Features
Portfolio Analysis: Analyze the current composition of an ETF portfolio.
Value at Risk Calculation: Compute the VaR for the portfolio to measure potential losses over a specified time frame.
Risk Optimization: Explore and propose adjustments to rebalance the portfolio and minimize VaR.

Optimization
Numerical Optimization - Gradient Descent
